Great approach! Let's first define all the **SQL queries** we need to perform, categorized by different aspects of the dataset. This will help us determine the **number of API routes** we need in `main.py`.  

---

- Find the **most frequent customers** (highest number of transactions).  
- Get **customer segmentation** based on income levels.  
- Find **customers who use coupons the most**.  
- Retrieve **customers with the highest average basket value**.  
- Get **customers who have not purchased in the last 6 months**.  
- Find the **age group that spends the most**.  
- Retrieve **customers who abandoned transactions (placed items in the basket but didn’t purchase)**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/customer`

- Find **products with the highest discounts applied**.  
- Retrieve **average price per product category**.  
- Get **impact of price changes on sales volume**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/product`

---

## **📌 4️⃣ Coupon & Redemption Queries**  
- Retrieve **total number of coupons issued vs. redeemed**.  
- Find **the most used coupon code**.  
- Retrieve **customers who redeem coupons most frequently**.  
- Get **the impact of coupon usage on sales**.  
- Find **percentage of transactions with coupons applied**.  
- Retrieve **top 10 high-value coupon redemptions**.  
- Get **customer segment that uses the most coupons**.  
- Find **products with the highest coupon redemptions**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/coupon`

---

## **📌 5️⃣ Marketing & Campaign Queries**  
- Retrieve **sales impact of each marketing campaign**.  
- Find **which campaign generated the most revenue**.  
- Get **customer engagement rate by campaign type**.  
- Retrieve **conversion rates for different campaigns**.  
- Find **campaigns that resulted in repeat purchases**.  
- Get **the most effective channel for marketing (email, SMS, social media, etc.)**.  
- Retrieve **sales uplift during campaign periods**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/marketing`

---

## **📌 6️⃣ Stock & Market Trends Queries**  
- Retrieve **real-time stock levels** of all products.  
- Find **products that are out of stock**.  
- Get **the impact of competitor pricing on sales**.  
- Retrieve **demand shifts by seasonality**.  
- Find **price elasticity of different product categories**.  
- Get **how stock availability affects customer purchases**.  
- Retrieve **competitor price comparisons for the last 6 months**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/stock`

---

## **📌 7️⃣ Dynamic Pricing & Customer Behavior Queries**  
- Retrieve **price changes and their effect on sales volume**.  
- Find **optimal pricing based on historical demand**.  
- Get **which customer segment is most price-sensitive**.  
- Retrieve **price change trends over the last 12 months**.  
- Find **impact of discounts on purchase frequency**.  

**🛠 Routes Needed:** `/pricing`

---

### **📌 Total Routes Needed in `main.py`**  
Based on the queries above, we will need **at least 7 routes** in `main.py`:  

```python
# FastAPI route registrations
app.include_router(customer.router, prefix="/customer", tags=["Customer"])
app.include_router(transaction.router, prefix="/transaction", tags=["Transaction"])
app.include_router(product.router, prefix="/product", tags=["Product"])
app.include_router(coupon.router, prefix="/coupon", tags=["Coupon"])
app.include_router(marketing.router, prefix="/marketing", tags=["Marketing"])
app.include_router(stock.router, prefix="/stock", tags=["Stock"])
app.include_router(pricing.router, prefix="/pricing", tags=["Pricing"])
```

This breakdown helps us:  
✅ **Define clear API endpoints** for each module  
✅ **Ensure all necessary business insights are covered**  
✅ **Make the system scalable** for future analytics
